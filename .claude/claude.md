# Dog Tinder

## Project Overview

I want to build an application that is essentially a Tinder for orphaned dogs. And so this is the ability to basically find and adopt a dog via swiping.


### Target Customer
Our ideal customer has discretionary income, the ability to adopt an animal, and is likely familiar with social media and apps. The primary thing is that they're capable of adopting an animal.


### Value Proposition
Customers will use our product because it's super fun, with lots of cute dog pictures. Plus, we'll pepper in some educational stuff to raise awareness about the issue. Yeah, it'll be fun, frictionless, and easy to use.

## Development Guidelines

When working on this project:

1. **Start with Context**: Always review the relevant sections of the PRD before implementing features
2. **Follow the Plan**: The implementation plan outlines the recommended development sequence
3. **Reference User Stories**: Each feature should map to user stories in the PRD
4. **Maintain Alignment**: Technical decisions should align with the architecture in the implementation plan

## Current Focus

The MVP focuses on these core capabilities:

- Core features should include:
- A swipe-like interface, similar to Tinder, so people can build a list of liked dogs.
- Easy appointment booking to visit the animal, showing the next available time slot.

See `confabulator/implementation-plan.md` for the complete development roadmap.

## Important Notes

- This is a both application
- All generated documentation is in the `confabulator/` directory
- The PRD contains the definitive feature requirements
- The implementation plan provides the technical roadmap
