## Product Overview
Dog Tinder is a mobile application designed to revolutionize the dog adoption process by offering a fun and engaging interface similar to the popular dating app, Tinder. Users can swipe through profiles of orphaned dogs, creating a personalized list of favorites, and easily book appointments to meet these dogs at participating shelters. This platform aims to address the critical issue of high euthanasia rates in shelters by expanding the market of potential adopters.

The application targets individuals with discretionary incomes who have the capacity and interest to adopt a dog but may not have been actively seeking one. By combining entertainment with education on the plight of orphaned dogs, Dog Tinder seeks to convert casual swipers into committed adopters. The platform matters because it offers a novel solution to increase adoption rates and reduce the number of dogs needlessly euthanized.
